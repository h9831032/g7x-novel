Command suspects a hostile entity or rogue faction may have seized the station, potentially gaining access to sensitive communication channels and strategic data. Your mission is to infiltrate Relay Alpha-7, identify and neutralize any threats, secure the station's control systems, and re-activate its primary communication functions. Time is critical.\n\n**Objectives:**\n1.  **Infiltrate Relay Alpha-7:** Gain access to the station, bypassing or neutralizing external defenses.\n2.  **Neutralize Hostile Presence:** Identify and eliminate any enemy combatants or systems occupying the station.\n3.  **Secure Control Core:** Reach and secure the station's central control core to prevent further hostile manipulation.\n4.  **Re-activate Communication Array:** Restore Relay Alpha-7's primary communication systems to full operational status.\n5.  **Report & Extract:** Transmit a status report to Command and await further instructions, or prepare for immediate extraction.\n\n**Location:**\nRelay Alpha-7, situated deep within the Serpent's Coil Nebula.\n\n**Known Threats/Challenges:**\n*   **Hostile Occupation:** Expect organized resistance from pirates, a rival corporation, or possibly an unknown alien force.\n*   **Environmental Hazards:** The Serpent's Coil Nebula is known for dense gas clouds, electromagnetic interference, and potential radiation pockets, which can affect sensors and shields.\n*   **Automated Defenses:** The station's own security systems may have been reprogrammed against you.\n*   **Limited Intel:** The exact nature and strength of the occupying force are currently unknown.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\nRelay Alpha-7 fully operational and secured under friendly control.\n\n**Potential Rewards:**\n*   Significant credit compensation.\n*   Reputation boost with Command.\n*   Access to salvaged data or technology from the station or neutralized hostiles.\n*   Promotional consideration.",
