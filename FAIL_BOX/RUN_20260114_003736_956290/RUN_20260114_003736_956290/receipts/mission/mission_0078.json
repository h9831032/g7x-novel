    "content": "Understood. Based on the \"TASK_V3\" format and the mission ID M078, I will generate a detailed mission brief.\n\n---\n\n## MISSION BRIEFING: M078 - \"Aetherium Anomaly Retrieval\"\n\n**Mission ID:** M078\n**Mission Name:** Aetherium Anomaly Retrieval\n**Client:** Galactic Scientific Directorate (GSD)\n**Priority:** High\n**Classification:** Research & Recovery, Hazardous Environment\n\n---\n\n### 1. MISSION OBJECTIVE\n\n**Primary Objective:** Infiltrate the derelict GSD Research Station \"Kronos-7,\" locate the primary data core containing Project Aetherium research, and extract all viable scientific data.\n\n**Secondary Objectives (Optional):**\n*   Recover any surviving personnel logs or personal effects.\n*   Stabilize or neutralize the residual Aetherium anomaly in the central reactor chamber.\n*   Secure residual research samples or prototypes from the Aetherium Containment Labs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. BRIEFING\n\nResearch Station Kronos-7, a remote deep-space facility dedicated to the highly secretive Project Aetherium, went dark approximately 72 hours ago. All attempts to establish communication have failed. Project Aetherium focused on harnessing exotic matter-energy interactions, a field with immense potential but significant risks.\n\nOur preliminary scans indicate severe power fluctuations and atmospheric breaches across multiple sectors, but structural integrity appears largely compromised in key areas. We are detecting residual energy signatures consistent with an uncontrolled Aetherium reaction, creating localized temporal and gravitational anomalies. The station's automated defense systems may still be active, operating on erratic power cycles.\n\nThe data contained within Kronos-7 is irreplaceable and critical for understanding the Aetherium phenomenon, both for its potential benefits and to prevent catastrophic misuse. Your team is tasked with a stealthy and efficient recovery. Minimize direct engagement where possible, as excessive energy expenditure could exacerbate the anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### 3. OPERATIONAL TASKS\n\n**Phase 1: Infiltration & Initial Assessment**\n*   **Task 1.1:** Approach Kronos-7 and identify a secure entry point.\n*   **Task 1.2:** Establish a minimal power conduit to critical life support and door systems in your entry sector.\n*   **Task 1.3:** Conduct initial sweep for immediate threats and environmental hazards.\n\n**Phase 2: Navigational & System Stabilization**\n*   **Task 2.1:** Navigate through the compromised sectors to the central power conduit.\n*   **Task 2.2:** Restore partial auxiliary power to the station's internal navigation and primary security systems to bypass lockdowns.\n*   **Task 2.3:** Map viable pathways to the Research Core.\n\n**Phase 3: Data Recovery & Exfiltration**\n*   **Task 3.1:** Locate and access the Project Aetherium Primary Data Core within the Research Core.\n*   **Task 3.2:** Initiate data extraction protocol (requires secure decryption keys and a stable uplink).\n*   **Task 3.3:** Once data extraction is complete, secure your exit path and rendezvous with your transport.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS & HAZARDS\n\n*   **Zero-Gravity/Partial Gravity:** Damage to gravity generators in certain sectors.\n*   **Atmospheric Breaches:** Localized vacuum and low-pressure zones. Requires environmental suits.\n*   **Aetherium Anomalies:** Unstable energy fields causing localized temporal distortions, gravitational fluctuations, and potential electromagnetic interference. Direct exposure is highly dangerous.\n*   **Erratic Automated Defenses:** Security turrets, drones, and lockdown protocols operating unpredictably due to power instability.\n*   **Structural Instability:** Damaged bulkheads, compromised flooring, and potential sudden collapses.\n*   **Radiation Spikes:** Localized radiation hazards near reactor core and Aetherium containment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. INTEL & KNOWN FACTORS\n\n*   **Station Layout:** Basic blueprints of Kronos-7 are available (refer to provided schematics).\n*   **Aetherium Properties:** Extremely potent, volatile, and interacts with spacetime. Unstable forms can create localized reality distortions.\n*   **Data Core Access:** Requires Level 4 GSD access codes and a specific frequency modulator.\n*   **Automated Systems:** Designed for non-lethal deterrents but can be overridden or disabled.\n\n---\n\n### 6. UNKNOWNS & POTENTIAL RISKS\n\n*   **Severity of Anomalies:** The full extent and unpredictable nature of the Aetherium anomalies are unknown.\n*   **Personnel Fate:** The fate of the Kronos-7 research team is unknown. Assume no survivors but proceed with caution.\n*   **System Integrity:** The true damage to the station's core systems (power, life support, security) is unverified.\n*   **Rogue AI/Entity:** While no organic life signs are detected beyond your team, residual energy patterns or compromised AI could present unforeseen threats.\n\n---\n\n### 7. RECOMMENDED RESOURCES & EQUIPMENT\n\n*   **Team Composition:**\n    *   **Engineer/Technician:** Essential for power restoration, bypassing security, and data extraction.\n    *   **Security/Combat Specialist:** For defense against automated systems and clearing hazards.\n    *   **Scout/Infiltrator:** For navigating dangerous environments and stealth.\n*   **Equipment:**\n    *   Environmental suits (Level 3 or higher).\n    *   Multi-tool/Datapad with universal bypass modules.\n    *   Portable Power Cell (for initial power restoration).\n    *   EM Pulse Disruptor (non-lethal against automated systems).\n    *   Bio-Scanner/Anomaly Detector.\n    *   Grappling Hooks / Mag-boots (for zero-G traversal).\n    *   Secure Data Uplink Module.\n    *   Medical Kits (standard issue).\n\n---\n\n### 8. SUCCESS & FAILURE CONDITIONS\n\n**Success Conditions:**\n*   **Mission Complete (Primary):** All viable Project Aetherium data extracted and team exfiltrated.\n*   **Mission Complete (Optimal):** Primary objective met, and at least two secondary objectives completed.\n*   **Mission Complete (Flawless):** All objectives met with zero casualties and minimal damage to station infrastructure.\n\n**Failure Conditions:**\n*   **Critical Data Compromise:** Project Aetherium data is corrupted, destroyed, or falls into unauthorized hands.\n*   **Team Elimination:** All operative personnel are incapacitated or killed.\n*   **Containment Breach:** Uncontrolled Aetherium anomaly expands beyond Kronos-7, threatening surrounding space.\n\n---\n\n### 9. REWARDS\n\n*   **Standard Completion:** GSD Credits (Base), Reputation Boost (Moderate).\n*   **Optimal Completion:** GSD Credits (Significant Bonus), Enhanced Reputation, Access to restricted GSD schematics/intel.\n*   **Flawless Completion:** GSD Credits (Major Bonus), Elite Reputation, Exclusive GSD Prototype Tech, Potential for follow-up high-value missions.\n*   **Data Recovery (per secondary obj):** Minor GSD Credit bonus, small Reputation increase.\n\n---\n\n### 10. DEBRIEFING (ANTICIPATED)\n\nUpon successful extraction, your team will undergo immediate quarantine and a thorough debriefing. The recovered data will be analyzed by top GSD scientists, and its implications will determine future strategic directives. Be prepared to provide detailed accounts of the anomalies encountered.\n\n---\n**END MISSION BRIEFING**",
