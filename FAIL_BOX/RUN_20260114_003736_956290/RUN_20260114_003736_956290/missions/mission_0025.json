  "content": "**Mission M025: Deep Dive: Anomaly Investigation**\n\n**Objective:** Investigate a newly detected deep-space anomaly, gather comprehensive data, and determine its nature and potential threat level.\n\n**Context:** Long-range sensors have detected an unusual and potent energy signature emanating from an uncharted region of space. The signature does not conform to any known natural celestial phenomena or artificial constructs. Understanding its origin and characteristics is critical for galactic safety.\n\n**Mission Brief:**\nYou are tasked with piloting a specialized, long-range scout vessel equipped with advanced sensor arrays into the anomaly's proximity. Your primary goal is to gather high-fidelity spectroscopic, gravimetric, and energy signature data. Analyze preliminary readings to identify patterns, potential origins, and any indicators of sentience or hostile intent. Report your findings and a comprehensive threat assessment back to command, including a recommendation for subsequent actions.\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n*   Navigating unpredictable energy fields and spacetime distortions.\n*   Encountering unknown hazards or intelligent entities.\n*   Limited information and potential for rapid escalation.\n\n**Required Output:**\n*   Detailed sensor logs and raw data.\n*   Preliminary analysis report.\n*   Threat assessment (Low, Medium, High, Unknown).\n*   Recommended next steps for Command.",
