  "content": "**Mission M070: Predictive Modeling - Customer Churn Analysis**\n\n**Objective:**\nDevelop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The goal is to proactively identify customers at risk of leaving so that targeted retention strategies can be implemented.\n\n**Context:**\nYou've been provided with a dataset containing various customer attributes and their churn status. Your task is to build, train, and evaluate a predictive model that can classify customers into 'churn' or 'no churn' categories.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n1.  **Python Script (`churn_predictor.py`):**\n    *   Load the provided dataset (`customer_data.csv`).\n    *   Perform necessary data preprocessing steps:\n        *   Handle missing values (e.g., impute, remove).\n        *   Encode categorical features (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).\n        *   Scale numerical features (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).\n    *   Split the processed data into training and testing sets (e.g., 70-30 split).\n    *   Train at least one classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) on the training data.\n    *   Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data, reporting the following metrics for the 'churn' class:\n        *   Accuracy\n        *   Precision\n        *   Recall\n        *   F1-score\n        *   A confusion matrix.\n    *   Include a function `predict_new_customer_churn(customer_features: dict)` that takes a dictionary of new customer features (matching the preprocessed input format) and returns their predicted churn status ('Churn' or 'No Churn').\n\n2.  **Brief Report (`report.md`):**\n    *   Summarize your chosen model's performance metrics.\n    *   Discuss the preprocessing steps taken and their rationale.\n    *   Explain your choice of model and any hyperparameter tuning performed.\n    *   Highlight any key insights or challenges encountered during the mission.\n    *   (Optional) Suggest potential improvements or next steps for the model.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*   **`customer_data.csv`**: A CSV file containing historical customer data.\n    *   **Example Columns:** `customerID`, `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`, `tenure` (months), `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`, `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Churn` (target variable: 'Yes' or 'No').\n*   **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n*   The `churn_predictor.py` script runs without errors and produces the required output.\n*   The model achieves reasonable predictive performance (e.g., an F1-score for the 'churn' class of at least 0.65).\n*   The `report.md` is clear, concise, and accurately reflects your work and findings.\n*   The `predict_new_customer_churn` function is correctly implemented and functional.",
