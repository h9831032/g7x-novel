Phase II involves the deployment of three new ground-based radar stations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) and the upgrade of the central data fusion and prediction algorithms. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy and speed of debris trajectory prediction, enabling more efficient collision avoidance maneuvers for active satellites and spacecraft.\n*   **Status:** In Progress\n*   **Start Date:** 2024-04-01\n*   **Estimated Completion:** 2025-09-30\n*   **Key Objectives:**\n    1.  Successful construction and calibration of three new radar stations.\n    2.  Integration of new sensor data into the central tracking system.\n    3.  Development and validation of improved predictive algorithms (version 2.0).\n    4.  Reduction in debris prediction error margin by 15%.\n    5.  Full operational readiness and handover to Space Situational Awareness (SSA) team.\n*   **Responsible Lead:** Dr. Elara Vance, SSA Division\n*   **Associated Projects/Tasks:**\n    *   P-M110-RS: Radar Station Deployment & Integration\n    *   P-M110-DA: Data Algorithm Development & Testing\n    *   P-M110-UC: User Interface & Control System Upgrade\n*   **Current Progress:** 35% Complete (Radar Station Alpha nearing completion; algorithm development in preliminary testing phase.)\n*   **Priority:** High\n\n---\n*If you were expecting different information or a specific update, please clarify your request.*",
