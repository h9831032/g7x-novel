Any identified mismatches will be flagged, reported, and steps will be taken to reconcile them according to predefined protocols.\n*   **Key Steps:**\n    1.  **Identify Datasets:** Pinpoint the specific tables, fields, and records to be verified.\n    2.  **Extract Data:** Securely extract relevant data from both primary and secondary systems.\n    3.  **Compare Data:** Perform a byte-by-byte or field-by-field comparison of the extracted data.\n    4.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Log all mismatches, including the affected records, fields, and the differing values.\n    5.  **Prioritize Discrepancies:** Categorize discrepancies based on their impact (e.g., critical, major, minor).\n    6.  **Generate Report:** Compile a detailed report of all findings.\n    7.  **Initiate Reconciliation:** For critical and major discrepancies, trigger the appropriate reconciliation workflow (manual correction, automated script, re-sync).\n    8.  **Verify Resolution:** After reconciliation, re-run verification for the affected data to confirm resolution.\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    *   Detailed Discrepancy Report.\n    *   Log of reconciliation actions taken.\n    *   Confirmation of data integrity (or remaining unresolved issues).\n*   **Status:** Ready for execution.\n\nPlease let me know if you are ready to initiate this mission or require further details/modifications.",
