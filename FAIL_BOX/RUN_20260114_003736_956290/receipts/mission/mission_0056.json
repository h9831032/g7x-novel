Your primary goal is to provide a detailed sentiment breakdown for each review, identifying not only the overall sentiment but also the specific product aspects or features being discussed and their individual sentiments. This will help a product development team understand user perceptions and pinpoint areas for improvement or recognize well-received features.\n\n**Primary Objective:**\nFor each given product review, you must provide:\n1.  **Overall Sentiment:** Classify the review's general sentiment as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.\n2.  **Key Aspects & Their Sentiments:** Identify and list the specific product aspects, features, or themes mentioned in the review, along with the sentiment associated with each identified aspect (e.g., \"Battery Life: Positive\", \"User Interface: Negative\", \"Price: Neutral\").\n\n**Secondary Objective (Optional but Recommended):**\n3.  **Common Themes/Summary:** After processing all reviews, provide a brief summary of recurring positive and negative themes, and any common suggestions or issues observed across the entire set of reviews.\n\n**Input:**\nA collection of product reviews (text strings), typically provided as a list.\n\n**Output Format:**\nFor each review, present the analysis clearly, ideally using a structured format (e.g., bullet points or JSON-like structure). A final summary section should be provided if the secondary objective is completed.\n\n**Example Output Structure (for a single review):**\n\n```\nReview Text: \"The new phone has an amazing camera and a sleek design, but the battery life is terrible. It also felt a bit pricey.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Overall Sentiment: Mixed/Negative (or Neutral, depending on weighting)\n- Key Aspects:\n    - Camera: Positive\n    - Design: Positive\n    - Battery Life: Negative\n    - Price: Negative\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n*   Accurate classification of overall sentiment for each review.\n*   Comprehensive identification and extraction of relevant product aspects.\n*   Correct sentiment classification for each identified aspect.\n*   Clear and concise presentation of the analysis.\n*   (If secondary objective pursued) Insightful summary of common themes.\n\n**Constraints & Considerations:**\n*   **Context:** Focus solely on product-related feedback. Ignore personal anecdotes or irrelevant comments.\n*   **Nuance:** Attempt to identify sarcasm, irony, or mixed sentiments where possible. Acknowledge when a review contains both positive and negative feedback.\n*   **Specificity:** Be as specific as possible when identifying aspects (e.g., \"screen brightness\" instead of just \"screen\").\n*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent approach to sentiment classification.\n*   **Impartiality:** Avoid introducing personal bias into the analysis.\n\n---",
