Its successful integration is critical for the colony's long-term sustainability and expansion.\n\n**Known Challenges/Threats:**\n*   **Rival Factions:** Intelligence suggests that corporate rivals or independent syndicates may attempt to intercept the core due to its immense strategic value.\n*   **Environmental Hazards:** The deep space transit route to Jupiter is prone to micrometeoroid showers and solar radiation bursts.\n*   **Internal Sabotage (Low Risk):** Standard protocols include checks for potential insider threats, though no specific intelligence points to this.\n\n**Current Status:**\nPreparation phase. The AI core is undergoing final diagnostics at Ares Station. The \"Stardust\" is being provisioned and prepped for departure.\n\n**Mission Briefing Focus:**\nEmphasize secure transport protocols, contingency planning for interception attempts, and strict adherence to environmental hazard avoidance maneuvers.",
