Retrieving details for `MISSION M102`.\n\n---\n\n**MISSION ID:** M102\n**MISSION TITLE:** The Rogue Signal\n**CLASSIFICATION:** Investigation, Data Recovery\n**STATUS:** Active\n\n**BRIEFING:**\nA faint, repeating distress signal has been detected originating from the derelict research vessel *Ares III*, which was abandoned nearly three cycles ago after a catastrophic system failure and presumed crew loss during deep space exploration. While the signal is fragmented and appears to be automated, its persistence suggests a deeper issue than initial assessments indicated, or perhaps a long-delayed secondary system coming online.\n\n**OBJECTIVE:**\n1.  **Infiltrate the *Ares III*:** Gain access to the vessel's bridge or main control room.\n2.  **Locate the Signal Source:** Pinpoint the origin of the distress signal within the ship.\n3.  **Retrieve Data Core:** Access the *Ares III*'s primary data core and extract all available logs and research data, specifically looking for information related to the anomaly detected before the ship went dark.\n4.  **Investigate Anomaly (Optional/Secondary):** If possible, identify the nature of the anomaly that caused the original system failure.\n\n**LOCATION:**\nOrbit of Planetoid Xylos-7, Sector Gamma-9, Outer Rim. The *Ares III* is drifting in a relatively stable but hazardous asteroid field.\n\n**KNOWN HAZARDS & CHALLENGES:**\n*   **Derelict Environment:** Power fluctuations, structural instability, depressurized zones.\n*   **Automated Defenses:** Remaining security systems may still be active, albeit degraded.\n*   **Environmental Dangers:** Micro-meteoroid showers are common in the asteroid field.\n*   **Unknown Entity:** The source of the original anomaly remains a mystery and could still be present or have left behind dangerous residues.\n\n**EXPECTED REWARD:**\n*   Credit Payout: 15,000 CR\n*   Reputation Boost: +10 (Exploration Guild)\n*   Bonus for Anomaly Identification: 5,000 CR + Rare Data Chip\n\n**RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:**\n*   Environmental Suit (Class B or higher)\n*   Utility Tool Kit (for bypassing security/repairs)\n*   Data Slicer/Hacking Device\n*   Long-range Scanner\n\n---\n\n**Proceed with caution.
