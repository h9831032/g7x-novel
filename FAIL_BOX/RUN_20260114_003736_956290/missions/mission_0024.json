It marked a significant moment of détente during the Cold War, demonstrating international cooperation in space.\n\n**Key aspects of ASTP:**\n*   **Purpose:** To test compatible rendezvous and docking systems and conduct joint scientific experiments.\n*   **Spacecraft:** An American Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) and a Soviet Soyuz 7K-TM spacecraft.\n*   **Docking:** The two spacecraft successfully docked in Earth orbit, allowing the American and Soviet crews to exchange visits, share meals, and conduct joint experiments for two days.\n*   **Crews:**\n    *   **US Apollo:** Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand, Deke Slayton.\n    *   **Soviet Soyuz:** Alexei Leonov, Valery Kubasov.\n\nASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft and played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for future international space cooperation, including the Shuttle-Mir program and the International Space Station (ISS).",
