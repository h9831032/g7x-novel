Okay, I understand. You want me to process the work described as:

**Work = 2**

For the task:

**TASK_V2|truck=B|box=29|payload=CHUNK_171**

This means you're giving me a piece of work to do (labeled "2") related to a task with these characteristics:

*   **Task Type:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 29
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_171

**Without further instructions, I can't actually *do* anything with this information.**  To process the work, I need to know *what kind* of processing is required.  For example, do you want me to:

*   **Store this information?** (e.g., "Store this information in a database under the task ID.")
*   **Validate this data?** (e.g., "Validate that truck B is authorized to carry this type of payload.")
*   **Perform a calculation?** (e.g., "Calculate the estimated delivery time based on truck B, the weight of CHUNK_171, and the destination of box 29.")
*   **Route this information to another system?** (e.g., "Route this information to the shipping department.")
*   **Compare this to existing data?** (e.g. "Compare the details to the manifest to see if it matches")

**Please provide more specific instructions on *what* to do with this data.  Tell me the *verb* (action) you want me to perform.**

**Example:**

"Store the following information in a temporary queue: work=2 for TASK_V2|truck=B|box=29|payload=CHUNK_171"
