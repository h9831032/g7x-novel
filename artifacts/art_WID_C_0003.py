Okay, I understand.  The task `TASK_V2` with `truck=C`, `box=41`, and `payload=CHUNK_243` requires an amount of `work=2` to be processed.

In other words:

**Action:** Process
**Work Required:** 2
**Task:** `TASK_V2`
**Attributes:** `truck=C`, `box=41`, `payload=CHUNK_243`

Let me know if you'd like me to do anything else with this information, such as store it, calculate related values, or execute a command based on it.
