Okay, I understand.  You're giving me the following information:

*   **Task Type:** `TASK_V2`
*   **Truck Identifier:** `truck=B`
*   **Box Identifier:** `box=22`
*   **Payload:** `CHUNK_132`
*   **Process Work:** `2` (units unspecified)

Based on this, my processing would be to acknowledge that the `TASK_V2` being performed on `truck=B` for `box=22` involving `CHUNK_132` has consumed 2 units of work.

Without further instructions, I simply understand and acknowledge the input.

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this information? For example:

*   Do you want me to store this information in a database?
*   Do you want me to update a running total of work done on `TASK_V2` or a specific truck/box?
*   Do you want me to prioritize tasks based on the remaining work needed?
*   Are you using a specific framework or model that I should be aware of?
