Okay, I will process the work.

Based on the input `TASK_V2|truck=C|box=47|payload=CHUNK_279` and `work=2`, the task is related to `TASK_V2`, uses truck `C`, box number `47`, and payload chunk `CHUNK_279`.  The specific work to be done is `2`, which suggests a particular step or stage in the overall task.

Since I don't have further context or predefined actions associated with "work=2," I can only acknowledge the information and state that I have processed it.

**Processed:**

*   Task: `TASK_V2`
*   Truck: `C`
*   Box: `47`
*   Payload: `CHUNK_279`
*   Work: `2`

**Next steps:** Without more information, I cannot perform a specific action. To proceed, I would need more context such as:

*   **The meaning of "work=2" within the context of TASK_V2.** Is it a stage number, a function to be called, etc.?
*   **Available actions or functions that can be executed based on the task parameters.**
*   **The desired outcome or expected result of processing this work.**

If you provide the specific action to be performed for "work=2" with the given task details, I can attempt to execute it.
