Okay, I will process the work request.

Based on the provided information:

*   **Work:** 2
*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 08
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_043

Processing work=2 implies doing the task twice with given parameters.

Is there anything more I should be doing? Do you want this repeated twice? Do you have any other specific instructions on *how* to "process" this work with that count?  For example, should I simulate this process and provide timestamps, or perhaps generate pseudo-code representing the task being performed? Please let me know if you have more information.
