Okay, I understand. The request is to process "work=2" for the following task:

*   **TASK_V2** (This indicates the type of task, likely version 2 of a task definition)
*   **truck=A** (This specifies that truck "A" is involved in the task)
*   **box=19** (This indicates box number 19 is involved)
*   **payload=CHUNK_109** (This indicates that the payload is chunk number 109)
*   **work=2** (This is the amount of work to be processed for this task instance)

In summary, you're asking me to acknowledge and understand that 2 units of work needs to be performed in relation to TASK_V2, involving truck A, box 19, and payload CHUNK_109.

What would you like me to *do* with this information?  Do you want me to:

*   **Store it?** (e.g., in a database or a record)
*   **Execute a function based on it?** (e.g., call a processing function with these parameters)
*   **Respond with a specific acknowledgement?** (e.g., "Work acknowledged" or a more detailed status message)
*   **Perform a calculation?** (e.g., add the 'work' value to a counter)
*   **Other?**

Please clarify what action you want me to take now that I understand the request.
