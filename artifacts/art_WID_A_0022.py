Okay, I understand.  You want me to process the work "2" for the task described by:

*   **Task Type:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck ID:** A
*   **Box ID:** 04
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_022

To process work=2, I need more context. **What does "work=2" represent? What is the goal?**

For example, is it:

*   **The number of boxes to load/unload?** (e.g., load 2 more boxes)
*   **The weight of the payload?** (e.g., the payload is 2 units of weight)
*   **The number of steps in a processing sequence?** (e.g., execute the next two steps)
*   **A signal to move to the next two parts of the process?**
*   **Something else entirely?**

Without knowing what "work=2" *means* in this context, I can't meaningfully process it.

**Please provide more details about what the 'work' value signifies and what you want me to do with that information.**

For example, you could say:

"Process work=2 for TASK_V2|truck=A|box=04|payload=CHUNK_022, where 'work' represents the number of boxes to load.  Therefore, *load two more boxes into box 04 of truck A, where the box contains payload chunk 022*."

Once I have that context, I can provide a more helpful and relevant response.
