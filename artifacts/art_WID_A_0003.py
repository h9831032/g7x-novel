Okay, I understand. The task is to process work with a value of 2, and the task is identified as "TASK_V2" with the following parameters:

*   **truck:** A
*   **box:** 01
*   **payload:** CHUNK_003

Therefore, the action to be taken is: **Process work with a value of 2 for TASK_V2 associated with truck A, box 01, and payload CHUNK_003.**
