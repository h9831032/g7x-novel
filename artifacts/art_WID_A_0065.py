Okay, I understand. The process being worked on has the following attributes:

*   **Work Value:** 2
*   **Task:** TASK\_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 11
*   **Payload:** CHUNK\_065

In simpler terms: You're dealing with a task called "TASK\_V2" that involves truck "A" and box number "11".  The payload being processed is "CHUNK\_065", and the current progress/work done on this process is "2".
