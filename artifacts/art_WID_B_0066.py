Okay, I understand.  The work process is 2 for a task with the following details:

*   **Task ID:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 31
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_186

This likely means that 2 units of some resource (time, effort, cost, etc.) are being allocated to processing the task described above.
