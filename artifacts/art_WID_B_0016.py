Okay, I understand. The process named "work=2" is being applied to a task described as:

*   **TASK_V2**: This likely refers to a specific task type or version.
*   **truck=B**: This indicates the task involves truck "B".
*   **box=23**: This indicates the task involves box number 23.
*   **payload=CHUNK_136**: This indicates the task involves payload identified as "CHUNK_136".

In essence, the process "work=2" is being performed on/for the task of moving or handling "CHUNK_136" with truck "B" and box "23" within the context of "TASK_V2".
