Okay, I understand. You want to apply the process "work=2" to the task described as:

**TASK_V2 | truck=B | box=22 | payload=CHUNK_131**

This implies that the "work" associated with this task should be assigned a value of 2.

Without more context about what "work" represents, or how this information is used, the best I can offer is that this likely means the task now has a work value of 2.
