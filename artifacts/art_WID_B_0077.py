Okay, I understand. The process `work=2` is being applied to the task:

**TASK_V2|truck=B|box=33|payload=CHUNK_197**

This means that the `work` value (likely an attribute of the process) is being set to `2` for the specified task, which is TASK_V2 involving truck B, box number 33, and payload CHUNK_197.
