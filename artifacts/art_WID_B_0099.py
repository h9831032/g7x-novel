Okay, I understand.  Here's the processed work based on your input:

**Work Breakdown:**

*   **Process:** `work=2` (This indicates the type or level of work to be done. It's likely a parameter or instruction for how to handle the task.)
*   **Task ID:** `TASK_V2` (This identifies the general type of task.)
*   **Specific Task Details:**
    *   `truck=B` (Truck assignment; likely Truck "B" is involved)
    *   `box=37` (Box identifier or quantity; likely relates to Box #37)
    *   `payload=CHUNK_219` (Payload identifier; likely refers to payload chunk "CHUNK_219")
