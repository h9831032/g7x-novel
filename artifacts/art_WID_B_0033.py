Okay, I will process the work "TASK_V2|truck=B|box=26|payload=CHUNK_153" with a work value of 2.

Since there's no explicit instructions on *what* to do with the data, and only a value to *process* it with, I'll assume the simplest interpretation.  I will simply acknowledge the task and its associated parameters, and indicate that the work has been "processed" using the assigned value.

Here's the response:

**Acknowledged.  Processed TASK_V2|truck=B|box=26|payload=CHUNK_153 with work value of 2.**
