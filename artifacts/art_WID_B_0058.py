Okay, I can process work=2 for TASK_V2 with the following parameters:

*   **truck:** B
*   **box:** 30
*   **payload:** CHUNK_178

This suggests that the second unit of work needs to be done on payload CHUNK_178. My capabilities are limited. Is there anything else I can do to help you or provide output?
