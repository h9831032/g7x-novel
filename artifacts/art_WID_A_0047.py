Okay, I understand.  You want me to process the "work=2" request for the task identified as:

**TASK_V2|truck=A|box=08|payload=CHUNK_047**

To clarify, please tell me **what "processing work=2" means in the context of this task.**

Without knowing what "work=2" signifies, I can only provide a generic response.  To give you a useful answer, I need to understand the meaning of "work=2" in relation to the TASK_V2 task type with its specific attributes (truck, box, payload).

For example, is "work=2" :

*   **A specific stage in a workflow?**  (e.g., "work=2" could mean "validate", "process", "deliver")
*   **A specific type of operation to perform on the payload?** (e.g., compress, encrypt, analyze)
*   **An instruction to route the payload to a specific service or component?**
*   **An indication of priority or urgency?**

**Once you provide that context, I can generate a much more relevant and helpful response.**
