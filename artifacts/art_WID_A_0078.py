Okay, I understand.  The instruction is to perform "process work" with a value of 2 for the task identified by "TASK_V2" and associated with the following attributes:

*   **truck:** A
*   **box:** 13
*   **payload:** CHUNK_078

In essence, you want to do some operation (indicated by "process work") on "CHUNK_078" which is located in "box 13" of "truck A" based on a Task called "TASK_V2".

Without knowing what "process work" *specifically* means, I cannot execute this instruction.  I need more context on what action should be taken with the payload CHUNK_078 for the task TASK_V2.

**Example: If "process work=2" meant "verify integrity":**

Then my response would be:  "Verifying integrity of payload CHUNK_078 in box 13 of truck A for TASK_V2. Result: (pending or success/failure)."  Then, I would *need* the necessary data/algorithms to actually check the integrity.

**Example: If "process work=2" meant "log size":**

Then my response would be: "Logging the size of payload CHUNK_078 in box 13 of truck A for TASK_V2. Result: Size logged as [example size value]." Again, I would need the size of the chunk.

**Please provide more details about what "process work=2" entails.  What specific action should be performed on the data/chunk?**
