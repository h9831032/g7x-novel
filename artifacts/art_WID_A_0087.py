Okay, I understand. Based on the provided information:

**Processing work with a value of 2 for the following task:**

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 15
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_087

**Essentially, you're telling me that the operation being performed on `TASK_V2` with the specified attributes has a "work" value of 2.  This "work" could represent units of time, cost, resources consumed, or any other metric relevant to your system.**

Is there anything specific you want me to *do* with this information?  For example:

*   Do you want me to store it?
*   Compare it to other work values?
*   Use it to calculate something?
*   Prioritize this task?

Let me know what you need me to do with it.
