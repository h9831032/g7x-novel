Okay, I understand. You want me to process the work unit that is:

*   **Process:** Work=2
*   **Task Identifier:** TASK\_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 05
*   **Payload:** CHUNK\_030

Now, tell me what kind of processing you want me to do.  I need more information to actually *do* something.  For example, do you want me to:

*   **Analyze the payload?** (If so, tell me what kind of analysis)
*   **Update a database with the information?** (If so, tell me what database and how)
*   **Route the payload to a different system?** (If so, tell me where)
*   **Simulate some kind of action based on the data?** (If so, tell me what action and what rules to follow)
*   **Just acknowledge that I received the information?**

**In short, what action should be performed related to the `work=2` assigned to this task and payload?**

Once you tell me what the desired processing is, I can give you a more relevant and helpful response.
