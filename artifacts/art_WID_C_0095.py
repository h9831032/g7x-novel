Okay, I understand. You want me to process work with a value of 2, given the context:

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** C
*   **Box:** 56
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_335

Since you haven't specified *what* processing you want me to do, I'll assume you want a simple acknowledgment and logging of the information.  Here's the information I will save:

*   **Work Amount:** 2
*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** C
*   **Box:** 56
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_335

Please tell me if you want me to do more than just acknowledge and record this information. For example, do you want me to perform any calculations, retrieve data, or take any actions based on this data?
