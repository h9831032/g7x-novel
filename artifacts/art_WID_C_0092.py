Okay, I understand.

You're giving me a task (TASK_V2) with specific parameters:

*   **truck=C:** The task involves truck "C".
*   **box=56:**  The task involves box number 56.
*   **payload=CHUNK_332:** The task involves payload "CHUNK_332".
*   **Process work=2:** This indicates that the work to be performed on this task has a value of 2 (presumably units of work, or a measure of progress).

**In summary, you're instructing me to process work (amounting to 2 units) for Task V2, involving truck C, box 56, and payload CHUNK_332.**

**How do you want me to respond?  Do you want me to:**

1.  **Acknowledge the instruction?** (e.g., "Understood. Processing 2 units of work for TASK_V2|truck=C|box=56|payload=CHUNK_332").
2.  **Tell you what processing it entails (if applicable)?** (If you have a defined process).
3.  **Simulate the work being done (if appropriate)?** (e.g., "Processing... 1 unit complete... 2 units complete").
4.  **Update a status (if you have a system for that)?**
5.  **Something else entirely?**

Please tell me what you expect me to do with this information.  For example, if this were a database update, I would need more context on the database schema and the meaning of "Process work=2".
