Okay, I understand. The provided process requires 2 units of work to be completed. The specific task being processed is `TASK_V2`, and it involves a truck identified as `C`, a box with the ID `45`, and a payload called `CHUNK_269`.

In summary:

*   **Work Required:** 2 units
*   **Task:** `TASK_V2`
*   **Truck:** `C`
*   **Box:** `45`
*   **Payload:** `CHUNK_269`

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this process? For example, would you like me to:

*   Track the progress of the work?
*   Estimate the time required to complete the work?
*   Alert you upon completion of the work?
*   Store this information?
