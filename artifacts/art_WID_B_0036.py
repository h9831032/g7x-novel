Okay, I understand. The process work request is:

**Process work = 2**

**For:**

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 26
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_156

**In essence, you want me to process task TASK_V2, with a work amount of 2, specifically related to truck B, box 26, and the payload identified as CHUNK_156.**

To help me do something useful with this information, please tell me what kind of processing you want me to perform. For example:

*   "Process work = 2 to **verify the integrity of payload CHUNK_156** for TASK_V2|truck=B|box=26"
*   "Process work = 2 to **simulate the loading of payload CHUNK_156** into box 26 on truck B for TASK_V2"
*   "Process work = 2 to **update the status of CHUNK_156 to 'processed'** for TASK_V2|truck=B|box=26"
*   "Process work = 2 to **estimate the time required to deliver CHUNK_156** via truck B to box 26 for TASK_V2"

Without knowing the *action* you want me to take, I can only acknowledge that I understand the data you provided. Please specify what you want me to *do* with it.
