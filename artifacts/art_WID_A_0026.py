Okay, I understand.  The process work value is 2 for the task identified by the following parameters:

*   **Task Type:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 05
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_026

In other words, the operation being performed is `PROCESS_WORK=2`, and it's associated with the context `TASK_V2|truck=A|box=05|payload=CHUNK_026`.

Do you have any further questions about this process work assignment, or would you like me to perform any other actions related to it (e.g., track its progress, explain what PROCESS_WORK=2 might mean in this context, etc.)?
