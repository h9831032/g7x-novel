Okay, I understand.  You want me to process the work with a value of 2, based on the following task parameters:

*   **Task Type:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 13
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_075

"Process" is a very general term, so I'll need more context to give you a *specific* action.  What does "process" mean in this context? Please tell me the specific action you want me to perform on these task parameters.

For example, are you asking me to:

*   **Log the details?** (If so, in what format?)
*   **Check if this task is valid according to some rules?** (If so, what are the rules?)
*   **Update a database?** (If so, which database and what fields?)
*   **Send a message to another system?** (If so, to which system and with what content?)
*   **Calculate something?** (If so, what should I calculate?)

Once you tell me what "process" means, I can give you a more helpful response.
