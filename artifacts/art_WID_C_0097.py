Okay, I will process work=2 for TASK_V2 with the following parameters:

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **truck:** C
*   **box:** 57
*   **payload:** CHUNK_337
*   **work:** 2

Essentially, I will execute the defined "work" associated with step number '2'  within the context of "TASK_V2," using the provided truck, box, and payload details.  What this means specifically depends entirely on what "TASK_V2" is defined to do, and what steps 1 and 2 entail.  I can't provide more details without knowing the actual definition of TASK_V2.
