Okay, I understand. Based on the input:

**TASK_V2|truck=C|box=43|payload=CHUNK_256**

You want me to perform a process where the `work` value is `2`.  The task involves:

*   **Task Type:** `TASK_V2`
*   **Truck ID:** `C`
*   **Box ID:** `43`
*   **Payload:** `CHUNK_256`

Since I don't know the specific function of TASK_V2, I can't perform a process. What output or response do you need?
