Okay, I understand.  The process is:

**Work = 2**

And the task being processed is:

**TASK_V2|truck=B|box=34|payload=CHUNK_199**

This likely represents a unit of work being done (perhaps processing a specific chunk of data) related to a task. The task involves:

*   **TASK_V2:**  A task identified as version 2.
*   **truck=B:**  The task is associated with a truck identified as "B".
*   **box=34:**  The task is related to a box numbered "34".
*   **payload=CHUNK_199:** The specific payload being processed is "CHUNK_199".

Essentially, you're indicating that "work unit 2" is being performed on the data chunk identified as "CHUNK_199" within a larger task related to truck B and box 34.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this information? Do you want to know what type of work is being done, or perhaps track the progress of this work unit?
