Okay, I understand.  You want me to process work with a value of 2 for the task identified by:

*   **TASK_V2**
*   `truck` parameter set to `C`
*   `box` parameter set to `49`
*   `payload` parameter set to `CHUNK_294`

In simpler terms:

I need to do "work=2" related to delivering box 49 on truck C, and the relevant data chunk is CHUNK_294 according to Task V2

Is there any specific action you'd like me to take with this information? For example, do you want me to:

*   **Log this information?**
*   **Update a database?**
*   **Perform a calculation based on this data?**
*   **Check the validity of the data?**

Please provide more context so I can give you a helpful response.
