Okay, I understand. You want me to process the following task and the result of the "process" is 2:

**Task:** `TASK_V2|truck=B|box=37|payload=CHUNK_217`

**Process Result:** `work=2`

Essentially, you're giving me an instruction that when presented with the described task, the result of some "process" applied to that task is equal to 2.  

There's nothing more for me to do here unless you have a question about this relationship, want me to elaborate or perform another function. Do you want to:

*   **Give me more similar examples to learn a pattern?** This would help me generalize the "process" from the task.
*   **Ask me to predict the result of the process for a new task?**
*   **Ask me to explain why the result is 2?** (I can't answer this without more information about the "process").
*   **Something else?**
