Okay, I will process "work=2" for the task identified by "TASK_V2|truck=A|box=03|payload=CHUNK_014".

In simpler terms, I will acknowledge that the amount of work associated with processing chunk 014 from box 03 on truck A for task V2 is 2 units.

I'm ready for the next instruction or piece of information related to this task. Let me know what else I can do!
