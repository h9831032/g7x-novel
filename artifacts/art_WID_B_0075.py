Okay, I understand.  You want me to process work with a value of 2 for the following task:

*   **Task Type:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 33
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_195

Given that "process work=2" likely implies a specific action or operation to be performed on this task, could you please clarify what the processing entails? For example:

*   **What type of processing should I do?** (e.g., Validate, Analyze, Route, Update status)
*   **What should I output?** (e.g., a success/failure message, an updated status, a calculated value)
*   **What does the "work=2" value signify?** (e.g., priority, number of attempts, a specific processing stage)

Without knowing the specifics of the process, I can only acknowledge that I understand the input.  I need more information to provide a useful response.
