Okay, I understand. You want me to process the work value of 2 for the following task:

**TASK_V2 | truck=B | box=36 | payload=CHUNK_211**

Essentially, this means you have a task (TASK_V2) involving:

*   A truck identified as 'B'
*   Box number 36
*   A payload identified as 'CHUNK_211'

And the assigned work value for this task is 2.

**Without more context, I can only acknowledge the information.**

**To be helpful, I need to know what "process" means in this context.**  What am I supposed to *do* with the work value of 2, given this task information?  Some possibilities include:

*   **Recording it:**  Logging the task and its associated work value.
*   **Adding it:** Adding the work value to an existing total or score related to the truck, box, or payload.
*   **Comparing it:** Checking if the work value meets a certain threshold or comparing it to other tasks.
*   **Calculating something:**  Using the work value in a formula with other task parameters.
*   **Prioritizing:**  Using the work value to determine the urgency or importance of the task.
*   **Allocating resources:** Using the work value to determine what resources (time, personnel, etc.) should be allocated to the task.

**Please provide more specific instructions on what to do with this information.** For example:

*   "Record the task and its work value in a database."
*   "Add the work value to the total work value for truck B."
*   "Compare the work value to a minimum value of 3. Is it greater than or equal to the minimum?"

Once I understand the desired outcome, I can provide a more useful response.
