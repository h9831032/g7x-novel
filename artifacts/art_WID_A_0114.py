Okay, I will process work=2 for TASK_V2 with the following parameters:

*   **truck=A**
*   **box=19**
*   **payload=CHUNK_114**

This means I am performing the second unit of work (work=2) for TASK_V2, likely involving truck A, box 19, and specifically the payload chunk identified as CHUNK_114.

I will proceed to the next step or provide results as needed based on the underlying instructions or logic associated with TASK_V2.
