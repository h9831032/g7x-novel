Okay, I understand. You want me to process work with a value of 2, given the context provided by the task definition `TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056`.

However, you haven't specified *what* processing I should do.  I need instructions on what to *do* with the "work=2" in the context of that task.

To give you a useful response, please provide more detail. For example, tell me to:

*   **Calculate something:** "Process work=2 by adding it to the box number.  TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056" (This would result in 12)
*   **Store it somewhere:** "Process work=2 by storing it as a property related to `CHUNK_056`. TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056"
*   **Compare it to something:** "Process work=2 and check if it's less than the box number. TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056" (This would result in True)
*   **Use it in a function:** "Process work=2 by passing it as the 'multiplier' argument to function `calculate_payload_weight` which also takes 'box' as an argument from `TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056`"
*   **Interpret it as a status:** "Process work=2 interpreting it as the number of workers assigned. TASK_V2|truck=A|box=10|payload=CHUNK_056"

**Without knowing what you want me to *do*, I can't give you a specific answer.**

Please provide clear instructions on what operation to perform with "work=2" in relation to the task details.
