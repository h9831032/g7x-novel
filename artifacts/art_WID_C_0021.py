Okay, I'll process the work unit.  Based on the provided information:

*   **Task:** `TASK_V2`
*   **Truck:** `C`
*   **Box:** `44`
*   **Payload:** `CHUNK_261`
*   **Work:** `2`

Without further context on the exact nature of `TASK_V2` and the meaning of the other parameters, I can only assume that the work to be done is related to loading or processing `CHUNK_261` within `box=44` using `truck=C`. Work = 2 could represent units processed, steps completed, or other similar measure.
