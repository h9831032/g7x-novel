Okay, I can process work = 2 for the task defined as TASK_V2 with the following parameters:

*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 36
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_212

Essentially, I will execute the work twice (work=2) for the specified task configuration. If you want me to do something specific with the "work," please provide more information.
