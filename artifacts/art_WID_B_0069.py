Okay, I'm processing the work.

Based on the input:

*   **Work:** Process work = 2
*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 32
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_189

Processing "work=2" usually implies a stage or a quantity related to processing this payload.  Without more context on what "TASK_V2" is meant to do, I can only interpret the data. I am noting the work value, which is 2.
