Okay, I understand.  You're giving me work (with a value of 2) to do, and the context is:

*   **TASK_V2**: This indicates the overall task is likely a version 2 task.
*   **truck=C**: A truck, identified as "C", is involved.
*   **box=41**: A box, identified as "41", is involved.
*   **payload=CHUNK_244**: The payload being handled is identified as "CHUNK_244".

So, essentially, you're saying:

"Process this data, giving it a workload of 2 units.  The task is version 2 and involves truck C, box 41, and payload CHUNK_244."

**What do you want me to *do* with this information?**  I need instructions.  For example, are you asking me to:

*   **Route this task to a specific processing unit?**
*   **Log this information for tracking purposes?**
*   **Perform some calculation based on the data (e.g., calculate the weight of the payload, or the distance the truck needs to travel)?**
*   **Check if the truck is compatible with the box type?**
*   **Mark Chunk_244 as ready to be delivered from box 41 on truck C**

Tell me what action I need to take based on this information. I need the 'what to do' to proceed.
