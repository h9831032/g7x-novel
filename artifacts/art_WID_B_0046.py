Okay, I understand. You want me to process the work unit with `work=2` for the task defined as:

*   `TASK_V2`
*   `truck=B`
*   `box=28`
*   `payload=CHUNK_166`

**What does "process work=2" mean in this context?**  I need more information to actually *do* anything.  Please tell me what action I should take with this information.  For example:

*   **"Process work=2" could mean:**  "Extract specific data from the payload `CHUNK_166` related to work unit #2 for box 28 on truck B."
*   **"Process work=2" could mean:** "Update a database record for TASK_V2 with the results of work unit #2 performed on box 28 by truck B, based on data in `CHUNK_166`."
*   **"Process work=2" could mean:** "Log the fact that work unit #2 has been completed for this task."
*   **"Process work=2" could mean:** "Route the payload `CHUNK_166` to a specific service based on the truck/box combination and work unit."
*   **"Process work=2" could mean:**  Calculate something based on the payload, truck, box and work parameters

**Without knowing *what* you want me to do with this information, I can only acknowledge that I understand the input.**

**To help me, please provide details on:**

1.  **The goal of processing "work=2". What should the outcome be?** (e.g., updating a database, generating a report, triggering another process, etc.)
2.  **What is `CHUNK_166`?**  (e.g., a file, a database entry, a message, a string, etc.)  What is its format? What does the data within `CHUNK_166` represent?
3.  **How is `work=2` related to `CHUNK_166`?** (e.g., work unit 2 corresponds to a specific section of the chunk, work unit 2 requires a specific calculation using the data in the chunk, etc.)
4.  **Are there any specific formulas, algorithms, or lookup tables that I need to use during the processing?**
5.  **Where should I store the results of the processing?**

Once you provide these details, I can give you a much more useful answer.
