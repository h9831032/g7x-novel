Okay, I understand. The input describes a task labeled `TASK_V2` involving a truck (`truck=C`), a box (`box=53`), and a payload (`payload=CHUNK_315`). The instruction is to process this task with a workload of 2.

Since "process" is very vague, and I have no context about what processing this task entails, I will simply acknowledge the information and indicate I'm 'processing' it.

**Response:**

Received TASK_V2 with truck=C, box=53, and payload=CHUNK_315.  Processing (workload=2). Acknowledged.
