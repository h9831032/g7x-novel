Okay, I understand. You want to process work with a value of 2, given the following context:

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** A
*   **Box:** 15
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_089

What specific action do you want me to perform with this information?  Knowing what you want to *do* with this "work=2" and the context will help me provide a useful response. For example, do you want me to:

*   **Store this data:**  (e.g., in a database, in a variable)
*   **Use it to make a decision:** (e.g., if work > 1, then...)
*   **Calculate something based on it:** (e.g., multiply the work value by the box number)
*   **Log this information:** (e.g., to a log file or console)
*   **Just acknowledge that I understand?**

Please clarify what you need me to do with this information.
