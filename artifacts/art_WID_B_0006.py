Okay, I understand.  Based on the input:

*   **Task:** TASK_V2
*   **Truck:** B
*   **Box:** 21
*   **Payload:** CHUNK_126
*   **Process Work:** 2

This represents a task (TASK_V2) involving a truck (B), a specific box (21), and a payload (CHUNK_126).  The "Process Work = 2" likely indicates that processing this task/component/payload requires 2 units of work or a process that takes 2 units of time (depending on the context).

Without more information about the system or process, it's difficult to say more definitively.  However, this breakdown should accurately reflect the meaning encoded in the input string.
