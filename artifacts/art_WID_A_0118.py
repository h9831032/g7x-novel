Okay, I will process the work.  Given the input:

*   **Process:** work = 2
*   **Task:** TASK\_V2
*   **Attributes:**
    *   truck = A
    *   box = 20
    *   payload = CHUNK\_118

Processing "work=2" means to perform work unit 2 related to this task.  Without further context on what "work" means in the context of `TASK_V2`, `truck=A`, `box=20`, and `payload=CHUNK_118`, I can only acknowledge the request.

**Acknowledged:** Processing work unit 2 for TASK\_V2|truck=A|box=20|payload=CHUNK\_118.
