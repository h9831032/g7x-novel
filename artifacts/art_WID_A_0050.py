Okay, I understand.  You want to process work with a value of 2 for the following task:

**TASK_V2|truck=A|box=09|payload=CHUNK_050**

This task describes a version 2 task (`TASK_V2`) that involves a truck labeled "A" (`truck=A`), a box numbered "09" (`box=09`), and a payload identified as "CHUNK_050" (`payload=CHUNK_050`).

You want to apply work value of `2` to this specific task.
