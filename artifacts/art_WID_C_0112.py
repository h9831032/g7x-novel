Okay, I understand. You want me to process work with a value of 2, given the following information:

*   **TASK_V2:** This is the task type.
*   **truck=C:** The truck involved is identified as "C".
*   **box=59:** The box involved is identified as "59".
*   **payload=CHUNK_352:** The payload is identified as "CHUNK_352".

And, based on this information, I need to know what processing to do when `work=2`.

Since there's no other information, I can't do anything other than store this in my memory.

To actually *process* this, I need *specific instructions* for what to do when `work=2` given these parameters. For example, I would need instructions like:

*   "If work=2, then calculate the weight of CHUNK_352 and add it to the manifest for truck C."
*   "If work=2, then log that box 59 with CHUNK_352 was loaded onto truck C."
*   "If work=2, then set status of box 59 to 'In Transit'."

**Please provide the specific instructions or logic associated with `work=2` in this context.**  I need to know what action should be taken based on the provided variables.  Once you give me the instructions, I can process the information accordingly.
