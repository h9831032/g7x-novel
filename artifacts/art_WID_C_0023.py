Okay, I will process work with a work value of 2 for the following task:

*   **TASK_V2**
*   **truck=C**
*   **box=44**
*   **payload=CHUNK_263**

Since you've given me the task and the work value, but haven't specified what "processing" entails, I'll assume that simply acknowledging and recording the information is sufficient.

**Response:**

Acknowledged. Work of 2 has been processed for TASK_V2 with truck=C, box=44, and payload=CHUNK_263.
