Okay, I understand. You want me to process work with a value of 2 for a task labeled "TASK_V2" with the following parameters:

*   **truck**: C
*   **box**: 53
*   **payload**: CHUNK_316

While you've provided the data, you haven't specified what kind of processing you want me to do. I need more instructions!

To help me understand, please tell me **what you want me to do with this information.**  Here are some examples of what you might be asking:

*   **"Verify the data. Is 'truck' a valid truck type?  Does 'box' 53 exist?"**
*   **"Store this data in a database or a specific format (like JSON)."**
*   **"Compare this 'payload' to another 'payload'."**
*   **"Log this information with the work value of 2."**
*   **"If the work value is 2, then do X with the data."**
*   **"Calculate something using the data."**

Please provide more context about the desired processing, and I'll do my best to help!
