Okay, I understand.  Given the task `TASK_V2|truck=B|box=40|payload=CHUNK_237` and "Process work=2", I will execute the second unit of work associated with processing that task.

Since I don't have any internal processing capabilities for tasks, trucks, boxes, or payloads, I can only acknowledge that I've received the instruction.

**Therefore, I acknowledge that I am processing work unit 2 for TASK_V2|truck=B|box=40|payload=CHUNK_237.**

If you need me to do something specific with the data (e.g., format it, extract a piece of it, or pass it on), please let me know what that specific work unit entails.  For example:

*   "Process work=2 for TASK\_V2|truck=B|box=40|payload=CHUNK\_237: Extract the box number." (I would then respond with: "Extracted box number: 40")
*   "Process work=2 for TASK\_V2|truck=B|box=40|payload=CHUNK\_237: Generate a confirmation message." (I would then respond with something like: "Confirmation: Processing payload CHUNK\_237 for box 40 on truck B.")

Without more specific instructions, I am just acknowledging that I am doing "Process work=2".
