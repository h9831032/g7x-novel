Okay, I understand. You want me to process work with a value of `2` for the task `TASK_V2` with the following attributes:

*   `truck`: `A`
*   `box`: `17`
*   `payload`: `CHUNK_101`

However, you haven't specified *how* I should process the work.  To give you a meaningful response, I need more context. Please tell me what you want me to *do* with this information.  For example, do you want me to:

*   **Log it?**  ("Log the task details and work value.")
*   **Store it in a specific format (e.g., JSON)?** ("Create a JSON object representing the task and work.")
*   **Use it in a calculation?** ("Multiply the work value by the box number.")
*   **Compare it to a threshold?** ("Check if the work value is greater than 1. If so, trigger something.")
*   **Send it to an external system?** (requires knowing where and how to send it)
*   **Just confirm that I understand it?** ("Confirm that I understand the input data.")

**Please provide more specific instructions on what you want me to do with the provided information.**  Once you give me a specific action, I can provide a helpful and accurate response.
